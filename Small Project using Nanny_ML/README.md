# NYC Taxi Tip Prediction: Model Monitoring Project

## Overview
This project uses the NYC Green Taxi Dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts tip amounts. The primary focus is on **monitoring and post-deployment analysis** rather than preprocessing or model training. The project can be found on this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/178e_MmCNCsiyqZ9XaDQoxSXX7fN2_960?usp=drive_link)

## Project Goals
- Deploy a machine learning model to predict taxi tip amounts
- Use NannyML to monitor model performance with unseen production data
- Investigate performance degradation through data drift detection methods
- Ensure the model maintains good performance in real-world settings

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two main sections:
1. **Preprocessing and Model Training** (minimal focus)
2. **Monitoring & Post-Deployment** (primary focus)

## Technologies Used
- NYC Green Taxi Dataset
- NannyML for model monitoring
- Data drift detection methods
